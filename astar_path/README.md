# ros-astar_path
ros package to compute a path with a changing map ( only a recomputation ) 


 - map_frame_ is the frame of the map (should be useless as it should be in the header of the Occupancy grid but it is not use yet)

 - base_frame_ is the frame of the robot

The output is a vector of point in map_frame.
